![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e06cbde9-0b6e-4d9b-a057-37667fd26bc9)

---
- Cleaned and prepared data for analysis
- Performed Exploratory Data Analysis to explore relationships between features and used visualization techniques to uncover insights.
- Feature Engineering: Selected and transformed relevant features to enhandce model performance.
- Implemented machine learning algorithms to predict lung cancer risk levels in patients.
- Performed model evaluation to assess machine learning models accuracy and reliability using metrics such as (precision, recall and F1 scores).

---

Key Insights:

- Across all machine learning models, the most influential features in predicting a high lung cancer risk level were obesity, dust allergy, and alcohol use.
- Several contributing factorsâ€”such as genetic risk, air pollution, age, and genderâ€”are non-modifiable and outside an individualâ€™s control.
- However, the most impactful and predictive features can be mitigated through lifestyle changes.
- Reducing obesity, limiting alcohol consumption, and avoiding smoking are actionable steps individuals can take to lower their risk of developing lung cancer.
- Clustering techniques proved useful for grouping individuals based on similar feature patterns, offering an additional method to assess lung cancer risk levels.

### Exploring Factors That Contribute to Student Math Scores Using Statistics and Machine Learning | Python, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scipy, sklearn, Plotly 
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b23d81ca-5eec-400b-b052-eeed1823978a)

---
- Performed Exploratory Data Analysis on features such as: Socio-economic status,
- Performed Statistical tests to determine if differences in math scores between different features was statistically significant (T-test, ANOVA, Welch's ANOVA, Tukey' HSD test)
- Used data visualization to uncover insights into how different features interact.
- Implemented machine learning algorithms (Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressorto determine degree to which features contribute to student math scores.
  
---
Key Insights:
- Socio-economic status is a big predictor in how students will perform on math tests.
- Parental level of education is also a very important factor in predicting student math scores.
- Test preperation also plays a role although not as much as the previous two features.
- Gender seems to play a slight role in student math scores.
- Students who completed a test preparation course outperformed their counter parts regardless of socio-economic status.
  
---
Suggestions based on the data:

- Policy makers should attempt to aquire funds to provide schools with a high population of students of low socio-economic status with test prepartion courses. Unlike other factors which are out of policy maker control, test preparation course are something that can be implemented and should have a positive effect on student math performance, especially for students who are free/reduced lunch as these are the lowest scoring students.

- Schools should prioritize test preparation courses as this is a factor that is with in their control.

## ðŸ’¼ðŸ“ˆ Customer Churn Prediction Using Machine Learning
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/47c1934c-97bf-4d00-8b9c-ccf1ea3794e6)

### According to Harvard Business Review:
- Increasing customer retention by just 5% can boost profits by 25% to 95%.
- Cost Efficiency: Acquiring a new customer is estimated to be 5 to 25 times more expensive than retaining an existing one
- Revenue Growth: Existing customers are more likely to purchase additional products and services, increasing their lifetime value and contributing to higher profits
- Loyalty and Advocacy: Satisfied, retained customers are more likely to refer others, generating organic growth through word-of-mouth



---

This project leverages customer data from **Telco**, a telecommunications company, to build a machine learning model that predicts whether a customer is likely to churn. Early identification of high-risk customers allows the company to proactively engage them through tailored retention strategiesâ€”reducing churn, increasing customer lifetime value, and improving overall profitability.

---

### Key Steps and Results

**Using Telcoâ€™s customer dataset, I was able to:**

* Explore and clean the dataset to prepare it for modeling.
* Build and evaluate three machine learning models:

  * Logistic Regression
  * Random Forest Classifier
  * XGBoost Classifier

**Key insights:**

* 89% of customers who churned were on a month-to-month contract.
* These month-to-month customers paid around $12 more per month** than those who stayed.
* Customers with Fiber Optic internet service were significantly more likely to churnâ€”possibly due to price dissatisfaction or service quality issues.
* Most churned customers did not have Online Security or Tech Support.
* Customers who paid via electronic check** were among the **most likely to churn.

**Model Performance:**

* The Random Forest** and XGBoost models** achieved strong performance.
* These models can be tuned to identify up to 90% of customers likely to churn.

---

### Business Recommendations

To reduce customer churn, I recommend:

* Target high-risk customers on month-to-month contracts with loyalty incentives.
* Investigate dissatisfaction among fiber optic users to identify pain points.
* Create tiered retention offers based on monthly charges to keep pricing competitive.
* Bundle support services like Online Security and Tech Support to increase stickiness.
* Improve onboarding experience for customers who pay via electronic check.
* Deploy predictive machine learning models to flag at-risk customers early and apply targeted retention strategies before they leave.

---

### Conclusion

This project not only highlights the power of predictive modeling in identifying churn risks but also demonstrates how data-driven insights can directly inform retention strategy and improve business outcomes.

### â˜• Coffee Case Study: Using Data Science & AI to Drive Smarter Business Decisions

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/43eb2a49-f249-4b48-b869-d8c83bd969d9)

In this project, I helped RR Diner Coffee, a specialty coffee company, make a high-stakes business decision using data science and machine learning. The company was considering a costly deal with a legendary coffee farm in Chinaâ€”Hidden Farmâ€”but needed to understand whether enough loyal customers would actually buy the product.

Using the companyâ€™s customer data, I:

- Explored and cleaned the dataset to prepare it for modeling.
- Built and evaluated decision tree and random forest models to predict whether loyal customers would purchase Hidden Farm coffee.
- Identified key features driving purchase behavior, including customer proximity to store locations.
- Found that customers living within 3 miles of a store were significantly more likely to buy, regardless of income level.
- Recommended against the deal in the current market due to the predicted purchase rate falling below the business threshold (69.65% vs. 70%).
- Suggested marketing strategies to grow the loyal customer base in high-conversion zones for future opportunities.

- This project showcased my ability to apply predictive modeling, feature analysis, and business-oriented data storytelling to support strategic decision-making.
