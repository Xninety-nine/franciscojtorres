### ☕ Coffee Case Study: Using Data Science & AI to Drive Smarter Business Decisions

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/43eb2a49-f249-4b48-b869-d8c83bd969d9)

In this project, I helped RR Diner Coffee, a specialty coffee company, make a high-stakes business decision using data science and machine learning. The company was considering a costly deal with a legendary coffee farm in China—Hidden Farm—but needed to understand whether enough loyal customers would actually buy the product.

Using the company’s customer data, I:

- Explored and cleaned the dataset to prepare it for modeling.
- Built and evaluated decision tree and random forest models to predict whether loyal customers would purchase Hidden Farm coffee.
- Identified key features driving purchase behavior, including customer proximity to store locations.
- Found that customers living within 3 miles of a store were significantly more likely to buy, regardless of income level.
- Recommended against the deal in the current market due to the predicted purchase rate falling below the business threshold (69.65% vs. 70%).
- Suggested marketing strategies to grow the loyal customer base in high-conversion zones for future opportunities.

This project showcased my ability to apply predictive modeling, feature analysis, and business-oriented data storytelling to support strategic decision-making.
