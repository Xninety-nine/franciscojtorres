### Lung Cancer Risk Prediction | Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Seaborn, Scipy 
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e06cbde9-0b6e-4d9b-a057-37667fd26bc9)


- Cleaned and prepared data for analysis
- Performed Exploratory Data Analysis to explore relationships between features and used visualization techniques to uncover insights.
- Feature Engineering: Selected and transformed relevant features to enhandce model performance.
- Implemented machine learning algorithms to predict lung cancer risk levels in patients.
- Performed model evaluation to assess machine learning models accuracy and reliability using metrics such as (precision, recall and F1 scores).

Key Insights:

- Across all machine learning models, the most influential features in predicting a high lung cancer risk level were obesity, dust allergy, and alcohol use.
- Several contributing factors—such as genetic risk, air pollution, age, and gender—are non-modifiable and outside an individual’s control.
- However, the most impactful and predictive features can be mitigated through lifestyle changes.
- Reducing obesity, limiting alcohol consumption, and avoiding smoking are actionable steps individuals can take to lower their risk of developing lung cancer.
- Clustering techniques proved useful for grouping individuals based on similar feature patterns, offering an additional method to assess lung cancer risk levels.

### Predicting Student Performance | Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Seaborn: 
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2e5f651a-0df2-4489-9bd6-feb98faf1ff4)


- Created  regression and classification models to predict student grades and academic failure.
- Achieved R² = 0.85 for regression model, enabling early interventions
- Classification model predicted student failure with 60% recall and passing with 88% recall. 
- Worked under guided mentorship and revised solutions based on weekly feedback cycles.
- Modeled stakeholder-driven outcomes and refined models through mentor collaboration.

### Exploring Factors That Contribute to Student Math Scores Using Statistics and Machine Learning | Python, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scipy, sklearn, Plotly 
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b23d81ca-5eec-400b-b052-eeed1823978a)


- Performed Exploratory Data Analysis on features such as: Socio-economic status,
- Performed Statistical tests to determine if differences in math scores between different features was statistically significant (T-test, ANOVA, Welch's ANOVA, Tukey' HSD test)
- Used data visualization to uncover insights into how different features interact.
- Implemented machine learning algorithms (Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressorto determine degree to which features contribute to student math scores.

Key Insights:
- Socio-economic status is a big predictor in how students will perform on math tests.
- Parental level of education is also a very important factor in predicting student math scores.
- Test preperation also plays a role although not as much as the previous two features.
- Gender seems to play a slight role in student math scores.
- Students who completed a test preparation course outperformed their counter parts regardless of socio-economic status.

Suggestions based on the data:

- Policy makers should attempt to aquire funds to provide schools with a high population of students of low socio-economic status with test prepartion courses. Unlike other factors which are out of policy maker control, test preparation course are something that can be implemented and should have a positive effect on student math performance, especially for students who are free/reduced lunch as these are the lowest scoring students.

- Schools should prioritize test preparation courses as this is a factor that is with in their control.


### ☕ Coffee Case Study: Using Data Science & AI to Drive Smarter Business Decisions

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/43eb2a49-f249-4b48-b869-d8c83bd969d9)

In this project, I helped RR Diner Coffee, a specialty coffee company, make a high-stakes business decision using data science and machine learning. The company was considering a costly deal with a legendary coffee farm in China—Hidden Farm—but needed to understand whether enough loyal customers would actually buy the product.

Using the company’s customer data, I:

- Explored and cleaned the dataset to prepare it for modeling.
- Built and evaluated decision tree and random forest models to predict whether loyal customers would purchase Hidden Farm coffee.
- Identified key features driving purchase behavior, including customer proximity to store locations.
- Found that customers living within 3 miles of a store were significantly more likely to buy, regardless of income level.
- Recommended against the deal in the current market due to the predicted purchase rate falling below the business threshold (69.65% vs. 70%).
- Suggested marketing strategies to grow the loyal customer base in high-conversion zones for future opportunities.

This project showcased my ability to apply predictive modeling, feature analysis, and business-oriented data storytelling to support strategic decision-making.
